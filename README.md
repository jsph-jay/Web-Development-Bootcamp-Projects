# Web-Development-Bootcamp-Projects
These are some examples of the interesting projects that I have created taking part in the Web Development Bootcamp Course on Udemy. 
At the moment, it is a mixture of HTML and CSS mainly but it will hopefully grow to include JS, Node.js and many more languages.
The size of the projects varies from very simple aspects of webpages (such as designing a button) to slightly more complicated projects (such as a mimic photo blog webpage)
