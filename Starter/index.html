              Kobe Bean Bryant was an American professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire
              20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded
              as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time
              All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA
              Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and
              ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring. He was posthumously voted into the
              Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

              After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant became the cornerstone of the
              Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. On January 22, 2006, he scored a
              career-high 81 points; the second most points scored in a single NBA game, behind Wilt Chamberlain's
              100-point game. Bryant led the team to consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, both times being named
              NBA Finals MVP. He continued to be among the top players in the league through the 2012–13 season, when he
              suffered a torn achilles tendon at age 34. His next two seasons were cut short by injuries to his knee and
              shoulder, respectively. Citing physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season. In 2017, the
              Lakers retired both his #8 and #24 jerseys, making him the only player in NBA history to have multiple
              jerseys retired by the same franchise.

              The all-time leading scorer in Lakers history, Bryant was the first guard in NBA history to play 20
              seasons. His 18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, and he has the most consecutive
              appearances as a starter. Bryant's four NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most
              in NBA history. He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba" in the mid-2000s, and the epithet became widely
              adopted by the general public. He won gold medals on the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams. In 2018, he won
              the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for the film Dear Basketball (2017). Bryant died, along
              with his daughter Gianna and seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, in 2020.[10] A
              number of tributes and memorials were subsequently issued, including renaming the All-Star MVP Award in
              his honor.
